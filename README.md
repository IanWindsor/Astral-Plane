This is a Web Application called The Astral Plane. It's a small project I work on when I find the time to further my understanding of Spring Boot, Hibernate, Flyway, and Bootstrap to design a simple web application. I play Dungeons and Dragons for fun, so I decided to use create a simple web page that I can use to find spells quickly.

I decided to use PostgreSQL as my database since I had never worked with it before and wanted to broaden my experience. I decided that my strategy for database work would be to leverage SpringBoots strengths by integrating Flyway to make database changes. I used Hibernate to validate the schema changes during startup, to make sure that Models and Tables would interact as expected and I could build queries using Hibernate for spell filtering with predicates.

The rest of the application is mostly boiler plate code with very ugly UI work. I'm not a UI designer, although I hope to improve one day.
